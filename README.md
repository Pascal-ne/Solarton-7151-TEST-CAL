Solartron 7151 test and calibration software for ar488.

Features at a Glance

-Allows someone with an AR488 GPIB controller to take full advantage of the GPIB-only 7151 calibration process.

-Long and short term data logging outputting the data in a CSV file for easy analysis.



What is the purpose of this software?

The Solartron 7151 and similar multimeters are highly capable devices with very solid accuracy and longevity, one way they differ from similar multimeters is that calibration can only be completed over the bus. 
This means that the simple act of calibrating a 7151 can be expensive and confusing as you not only have to buy a GPIB controller but also need to learn the specific commands and process to calibrate the multimeter.  This is why I decided to develop this software for the AR488 as its a very low cost (as little as £10) GPIB controller that works extremely easily with very little set-up required. More info on the AR488 can be found here AR488 Github

The second feature of the software aside from the calibration routine is the long and short term logging. This allows the user to log data for any amount of time they desire with any amount of interval they desire (as long as it isn’t shorter than the measurement time) It will then be saved as a CSV file in the location of your choice for easy analysis in external software like excel. 

Lastly I would like this software to be useful to you so if you have any changes you’d like to make please send a pull request or fork it on Github. If you have any questions or suggestions please E-mail me at pascal@pascalne.com.
